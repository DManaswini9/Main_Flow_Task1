# 📊 Main Flow – Data Science with Python (Internship Task 1)

## 🔍 About the Project
This mini project is part of my **Data Science with Python internship**, where I analyzed a real-world dataset related to **student academic performance**. The objective was to perform **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and answer key business questions using **Python libraries** like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.



## 🗂 Dataset Used
**Student Performance Dataset**  
📁 File: `student-mat.csv`  
📌 Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)



## ✅ Objectives Completed
- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Check for missing values and clean data  
- Answer 4 business questions using data analysis  
- Create visualizations to support insights  



## 📚 Internship Questions Answered
1. What is the **average score** in math (G3)?
2. How many students scored **above 15** in G3?
3. Is there a **correlation between study time and G3**?
4. Which **gender** has a higher average G3 score?



## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy – Data Processing  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization  


## 📈 Sample Visualizations
- 📊 Histogram of G3 scores  
- 📈 Scatter plot: Study Time vs G3
